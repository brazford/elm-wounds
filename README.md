# elm-wounds
A chess-like game written in Elm

This is a very preliminary implementation which helped me learn Elm programming. 

It needs both an AI opponent, and a web server for human to human game play.

It also lacks tests.

Some of the code looks pretty weird. I needed to do some dances to get Elm to obey me. So this may get refactored later.
